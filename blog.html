<blog title="minblog Overview">
This file is called minblog, for "minimalist blog". It's my attempt at creating the simplest possible blogging framework that meets these conditions:

- No build step
- Markdown support
- Math equation support
- Automatic generation of the list of posts
- No need to learn an obscure syntax to enter posts

# Installation

There is no installation.

# Usage

Open this file in a text editor. To add a new post, go to the top and type

<code><pre>
&lt;blog title="..."&gt;
</pre></code>

where the `...` is the title of your post.

Then type your blog post in markdown format.

Then add a closing tag:

<code><pre>
&lt;/blog&gt;
</pre></code>

Finally, open the file in a web browser.

<blog title="This thing has markdown support">
You can put markdown in here as long you don't close out the `blog` tag.

- Lists work
- Even has math support: $y_{t} = \xi_{t}$.

The markdown variant I'm using is [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it). You can see below the links used to load the library. If you want to use a different markdown library, all you have to do is delete the markdown-it lines and add your own. Further, markdown-it comes with math support, so katex is loaded. You can delete those two lines below if you don't plan to use math in your blog.

The only place the markdown library is called is the `md.render` call in the `changecontent` function. If you change markdown libraries, you'll need to change that call.

<blog title="There's almost no CSS">
There's very little CSS in here:

- Widescreen monitors these days are *too wide* to go without some limits.
- Links do not look good with underlines on here. I use underlines in some of my own html pages, but you don't want them here, where links are used for lists of blog posts.
- It's dead simple to change the styling yourself.
  - Go to the `style` tag below.
  - Add the CSS you want.
  - Profit.
  - Use [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) if you're not sure how to add particular CSS.
